# Office Allocation Problem

This project focuses on solving the office allocation problem proposed on the 2019 Reply Challenge. In the challenge, given a map of the area, terrain and location of customer, competitors were asked to find the optimal positions of offices such that the overall distance/cost between customer and offices was mininal.

The solution required the implementation of a path finding algorithm (A*) to calculate the cheapest path between two coordinates in the map. I also needed to implement a version of the K-Means Clustering algorithm in order to group customers and find the best position for the offices.
